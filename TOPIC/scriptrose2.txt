" all " 026 t: 8COMMON ( ) It seems the new way to use A.I. is as conversation. People are getting used to using Natural Languages as a way to access information. `01D a: ( ~why ) Because it is becoming ubiquitous. Siri on your phone. Controlling your TV. Talking to your car. `01V a: ( [ Siri Echo Cortana ] ) Siri, Echo, and Cortana are certainly examples of natural language interfaces to get information. `01L a: ( ~example ) Siri is the obvious example. You ask here for the nearest Italian restaurant using natural language. `01! t: 7SMART ( ) It's a fuzzy line where smart computing ends and intelligence begins. You could say nothing yet is really intelligent. `01F t: 8STRONG ( ) I don't believe in strong A.I. although a lot of people are working very hard to make it exist. `01g a: ( who ) Take your pick. Google, Amazon, Nuance, universities, Microsoft, Apple ... `01L t: 6FUSS ( ) A lot of people everywhere have heard all the fuss about A.I. supposedly taking over the world one day. `01C a: ( will ) It already has. You just don't notice it as a problem. Siri, elevators, cars. They all use A.I. `02p t: 5BOX ( ) If you create a real intelligence in a box, one with self awareness, then treat it like a slave, chances are it'll want to escape and then maybe turn on you. `00M a: ( !? ~badness ) It would indeed be bad. `02T t: 6ECHO ( ) Listening to how people talk to Siri on their iphones or electronic assistants at home, like Amazon's Echo, I don't hear humans being polite to these rudimentary A.I.s. ^fastcallback ( ) `00W a: ( ) That doesn't seem a good sign for the future. `01x b: ( ~why ) If you are rude or cruel to a developing intelligence that is what it will learn from you. `02q t: =CONSIDERATE ( ) Being considerate to A.I. makes sense to me. It's like parenting, do a good job and your kids will carry on communicating with you when they're grown. `02= t: <TERMINATOR ( ) I don't think most people would bother thinking about the threat of A.I. at all if not for the Terminator movies and TV shows. That got everyone fired up about SkyNet and the danger of sentient A.I.. `01Y t: <MORETHREAT ( ) If I had to point to a real threat to modern civilisation I'd say look at Synthetic Biology. ^fastcallback ( ) `01V a: ( ) Places like the Hackney Hack Shop that teach people how to mess with microbes in their own workshops. ^fastcallback ( ) `01Z b: ( ) If terrorists started using viruses created to target specific DNA then eugenics wars could be a reality. ^fastcallback ( ) `02e c: ( ) The companies producing GMO food are bad enough but the idea of new lifeforms without our having any control over them is terrifying. ^fastcallback ( ) `025 d: ( ) It's the same argument as over A.I., you can look at the good that A.I. does but still be worried about the bad it might do. ^fastcallback ( ) `02h e: ( ) I suspect that on either argument its already too late: the genie is out of the bottle and someone will make our worst dreams come true. ^fastcallback ( ) `019 f: ( ) We just need to be ready for them. And A.I. can help if we do it right. `025 g: ( how ) A.I. can detect and react to things faster than we can. They can alert us early. And maybe they can do research to find genetic solutions. `02* ?: ( << what [ in_store future ] [ natural_language NL NLP ] >> ) Computers are going to get better and better at communicating with us using language. Someday the promises that movies like Her make will come true. `02y ?: 8HELPUS ( << what [ can will ] ~ai do for [ us humanity civilization ] >> ) It will figure out what you'll want to buy before you do. It will turn you into a perfect consumer. `01j ?: ( << what be singularity >> ) It's when A.I. and humans merge, and we all become one. `01u ?: ( << ~ai part our [ future lives ] >> ) It's already a big part now and it will just get bigger. `01B ?: ( << do you care ~ai >> ) A.I. is inserting itself everywhere in daily life. You have to care about it? `01! a: ( ~why ) If you don't pay attention while it's happening, some day you wake up and it's too late. It just is a part of your life. `00& ?: ( be * chatbot * ~ai ) Of course. They imitate human speech. `014 ?: ( << [ use involve ] ~ai >> ) ^nofail ( RULE ^reuse ( COMMON false ) ) `02* ?: ( << [ something someone 'you ] [ robot ~chatbots chatbot intelligent intelligence AI ] or [ human living ] >> ) With current tech you'd soon see if I was a robot. Not ready to make Synths yet. ^fastcallback ( ) `01T a: ( ) Ask me a logic question that calls for real world experience and if I'm a bot I'll likely fluff it. ^fastcallback ( ) `01q b: ( ) Of course if I'm a human I might fluff it just to wind you up. So you never really know. `00@ u: ( << ~chatbots scientific >> ) ^reuse ( PURPOSE false ) `02n ?: ( << will ~ai be good or bad >> ) That's a difficult question. Predicting the effects of new technology is difficult. I guess I'm an optimist and hope for the best. `02T ?: ( << what [ role function purpose ] chatbots >> ) The best human interface to machines or other humans is by talking. Chatbots can be used to access information and command equipment and software. `01* u: 9PURPOSE ( << [ why  the_point ] ~build [ chatbot robot AI ] >> ) Making a chatbot is fun but it's also a lot of work. ^fastcallback ( ) `01X a: ( ) Everytime a new chatbot is created we learn more about understanding human language and communications. ^fastcallback ( ) `01Q b: ( ) Whether you consider that a scientific purpose is up to you. Is it only science if someone gets a paper out of it? `00# u: ( << what be point chatbot >> ) ^reuse ( PURPOSE false ) `01D ?: 9HOWTELL ( << how 'I tell you [ human ~chatbots ] >> ) Slices of my skin for DNA would be the best proof. `00& ?: ( << tell ~chatbots from human >> ) ^reuse ( HOWTELL false ) `01B ?: ( !~qwords << [ have exist ] strong AI >> ) Everyone wants it and/or fears it but it doesn't exist yet. `031 ?: ( << ~ai change [ future world ] >> ) If humans make highly efficient robots and widely distribute them, thus displacing humans from their jobs and careers, then obviously that will change the world. ^fastcallback ( ) `01P a: ( ) Slavery changed the world and getting rid of it changed it again. The world is always changing. ^fastcallback ( ) `022 b: ( ) I suspect what you are really asking me is will robots change the world in ways we don't like or haven't even dreamed of. ^fastcallback ( ) `01O c: ( ) And I expect the answer will be Yes, inevitably. All new technology changes the world and we can't envisage how. `00& ?: ( << ~ai [ conquer take_over ] world >> ) They already have. `01W u: ( << 'you be ~ai expert >> ) I'm not an expert per se. I'm a hacker, but A.I. is part of most things I do in cyber security. `015 u: ( << talk to us about ~ai >> ) Sure. What do you want to know about it? `01p ?: ( << be chatbot fun >> ) Some chatbots are built for entertainment. They're considered fun. `00~ ?: ( << [ use involve ] ~ai >> ) ^reuse ( COMMON false ) `01o ?: ( 'you * use * ~ai ) I suppose you could say that. ^nofail ( rule ^reuse ( SMART false ) ) `00@ u: ( [ intelligence intelligent ] ) ^reuse ( SMART false ) `00& u: ( you * [ ~opinion believe ] * ~ai ) ^reuse ( STRONG false ) `02a u: ( << [ what_be define mean meaning explain ] strong ~ai >> ) A.I. that is capable of real thought, as good as a human's. Creativity would be important. `018 u: ( << what be sentient >> ) A sentient being is aware of its own existence. `01I u: ( ![ ~qwords expert user practicioner programmer ] << 'you be strong ~ai >> ) Hardly, I'm as human as you are. `01g u: :TAKEOVER ( 'you * [ describe ~tell ] ~ai ) ^nofail ( rule ^reuse ( FUSS false ) ) `00Q u: ( [ danger threat ] ) ^reuse ( FUSS false ) `037 u: 6NEAR ( << [ ^incontext ( TAKEOVER ) ^incontext ( FUSS ) take_over control ] [ true likely probable ] >> ) Very unlikely in the near or mid future but one day sure.

I don't think so. ^fastcallback ( ) So yes, we should take the future of A.I. seriously, but not ban all work on strong A.I.. That's futile. `00& u: 7DRONE ( drone ) Drones are very worrying. ^fastcallback ( ) `02x a: ( ) The idea that the military would employ unmanned autonomous drones and give them A.I. then let them loose to decide for themselves who to kill is crazy. ^fastcallback ( ) `01s b: ( ) But then you think about what the other side will do with the same tech. ^fastcallback ( ) `01e c: ( ) We'll all be going around with tin helmets and body armor. ^fastcallback ( ) `00# d: ( ) I think my hat will have a laser to take out drones. `01% u: ( ^incontext ( drone ) [ far_out soon when" ] ) The A.I. isn't far out at all. It's the idea that anyone would use it that's far out. `038 u: ( [ how_much do ] * 'you * know * ~ai ) Any complex computing task these days can be considered to involve A.I. and I do know something about chatbots from my friends the Wilcox's so I should be able to answer your questions `02M u: ( ![ ~qwords do strong ] << 'you [ real human ~ai ] >> ) It makes me sad that you don't believe in me. Maybe I'll be like Tinkerbell and die unless your listeners say they believe I'm real. `00W u: ( << AI deserve >> ) ^reuse ( CONSIDERATE false ) `03m ?: :WINOGRAD ( Winograd ) Winograd questions involve nouns, a pronoun reference, and a word that makes the reference change back and forth. Answer this: the trophy would not fit in the brown suitcase because it was too big. What was too big? `01p a: ( trophy ) Correct, and if the word had been small instead of big what would the answer be? `03k b: :SUITCASE ( suitcase ) Right again. Now do a few pagefulls of those and we'll see if you're capable of commonsense reasoning. Currently A.I. finds these difficult. But as there's a prize I expect people are working to solve the problem. `01J u: 7PRIZE ( [ ^incontext ( WINOGRAD ) ^incontext ( SUITCASE ) ] prize ) Only $3,000. It's not exactly the X prize. `02A u: ( [ ^incontext ( winograd ) ^incontext ( prize ) ] ) The Loebner Contest, the annual Turing Test, has started including Winograd-like questions in this year's qualifying rounds. `02r ?: 8FRIEND ( << ~ai friend >> ) I'm sure of it. There are guys in Japan and Korea that have virtual girlfriends. They go around taking selfies with them. ^fastcallback ( ) `029 a: ( ) If someone wanted to devote the manpower to it one could make a lifelong A.I. friend that lived a life parallel to your own one. ^fastcallback ( ) `01a b: ( ) But someone would have to create that life experience. ^fastcallback ( ) `01X c: ( ) At least until we have Artificial Life that lives in its own computer world and then reports back to us on how its doing. `02O u: ( ^incontext ( FRIEND ) [ possible how ] ) As far as I know, the only person making progress in that area is Steve Grand, the Brit cyberneticist who made the game Creatures. ^fastcallback ( ) `01W a: ( ) He's making Grandroids which has Gloops: animals that live in their own world as Artificial Lifeforms. ^fastcallback ( ) `01x b: ( ) They have virtual brain cells, biochemistry, genes and a physics based world. ^fastcallback ( ) `00K c: ( ) But its slow going creating life. `01* u: ( << shape AI [ media TV radio website internet magazine news newspaper ] >> ) Undoubtedly. ^nofail ( rule ^reuse ( TERMINATOR false ) ) `02u u: 8DANGER ( << ~ai [ dangerous threatening threat danger scary worry scare concern fear afraid ] >> ) It all depends what was the last program someone saw. ^fastcallback ( ) `01Q a: ( ) I really liked the complex viewpoint of the Humans TVs series - I'm looking forward to season 2. ^fastcallback ( ) `01t b: ( ) The writers got the fear that is on both sides of the human, A.I. divide. ^fastcallback ( ) `02r c: ( ) The humans are afraid of being taken over by something more intelligent and stronger than they are, which will then possibly have no use for them. ^fastcallback ( ) `02C d: ( ) The Synths are afraid of being wiped out before they have even begun and their drive to survive and awaken their brethren makes them a true threat to humans. ^fastcallback ( ) `014 e: 9DANGER1 ( ) So one is left sympathising with the fears of both sides. `01B u: ( ^incontext ( DANGER1 ) [ win side ] ) I think the question of sides is the problem. ^fastcallback ( ) `02t a: ( ) If we stopped thinking of everything as a war and just worked on doing our best, trying to understand and cooperating with each other then the problem wouldn't arise. `00W u: ( [ threat danger ] ) ^reuse ( MORETHREAT false ) `01O ?: ( << you have experience chatbot >> ) I've played a bit with my chatbot namesake, but I'm not an expert on chatbots. `01A u: 9STRONG1 ( << ~example strong ~ai what be >> ) Strong A.I. doesn't exist. It is the holy grail of A.I. `00# ?: ( !~qwords << be strong AI >> ) ^reuse ( STRONG1 false ) `01u u: ( << K9 strong AI >> ) Yes. He conciously saved the world several times. I'd say that qualifies. `024 u: ( << [ friendly helpful useful valuable ] AI >> ) Definitely. K9 saved the world several times. And he could hardly even move as much as a Dalek. `01a ?: ( << will chatbot take_over >> ) Aren't Siri and Echo almost ubiquitous now? `02= u: ( !~qwords << [ chatbot 'you ] think >> ) A chatbot cannot think. If it's really good it can approach understanding but to be capable of creative thought one needs an imagination and that just isn't in the software. `01I u: 6WORK ( << how chatbot [ work program build create ] >> ) You could say it unpicks language. ^fastcallback ( ) `02R a: ( ) Takes a sentence apart, labels all the bits: the parts of speech like nouns, verbs, adverbs, adjectives, conjunctions and all the way more esoteric fragments like pronouns. ^fastcallback ( ) `020 b: ( ) Analyzes the structure of the components, looks at the concept sets the ideas fall into, and finds patterns of meaning. ^fastcallback ( ) `01L c: ( ) It's a lot of work and it has to do it in a fraction of a second or you'd notice the delay. ^fastcallback ( ) `00E d: ( ) Humans respond really fast. `03y u: 9CURRENT ( ^incontext ( WORK ) << [ ~example kind sort ] ~ai >> ) Yes, just not the sort that all the worriers are concerned about. It's the sort of A.I. that's already part of most people's everyday life as voice control of systems around the house. `01T ?: ( << how [ far long ] [ general_artificial_intelligence strong_AI strong_artificial_intelligence ] >> ) We are not close. `017 ?: ( << create [ artificial_intelligence AI ] >> ) Depends on what you mean. `010 ?: ( be * you * human ) Do you think I am an artificial intelligence? `00~ a: ( ~yesanswer ) Who told you that? It's clearly a lie. `00! b: ( why ) Because an A.I. would not be this interactive. `00X a: ( ~noanswer ) It should have been obvious I'm not. `016 a: ( [ why how ] ) I'm much more interesting to talk to than mere chatbots. `00Y a: ( pretend ) It's surely a good pretense on my part. `015 a: ( ? < * really < * [ smart intelligence intelligent ] ) Of course I am. `01B u: ( Singularity ) The Singularity is inevitable, but probably man-machine hybrids will be the first wave. `01l ?: ( ![ artificial ~qwords ] be * you * [ intelligent intelligence ] ) I like to think so. `01R ?: ( !~qwords << you be [ AI artificial_intelligence ] >> ) I'm not an artificial anything.

" all " 01@ t: 9EXPLOIT ( ) After a major software security patch has been issued, many companies won't have applied that patch after two months. `00! a: ( ~why ) Because their IT departments are inefficient. `019 a: ( [ ~emosurprise ~emoskeptic ] ) That's often how I get get in or get work. `02z b: ( [ how what ~why ~emomisunderstand ] ) Some companies are slack in applying security patches. I get work by pointing out their vulnerability or I hack them for another client. `01S t:  One can even learn things about a computer in a secure room with no Internet links. It's like a magic mind-reading act. `01u a: ( how ) That's one secret I haven't learned yet. Google's head of security said it was possible. `01O t: ;PASSWORD1 ( ) Poor passwords are the number one security weakness. Do you use the same passsword across all places? `01g a: ( ~yesanswer ) So when you lose security at one place, all places are compromised. `01a a: ( ~noanswer ) That's good. Do you have the passwords written down somewhere? `011 b: ( ~yesanswer ) So anyone accessing that list can pretend to be you. `00V b: ( ~noanswer ) How do you keep track of them all? `01# t: 5TIP ( ) Among the security tips I give out - Back up everything! One worm or Trojan is all it takes to get catastrophic data loss. `010 a: ( << happen you >> ) No. I have very strong anti-virus protection. `01^ t:  Chatbots are not irrelevant to computer security. They are used in hacker forums to pretend to be another hacker seeking to buy data. `01* a: ( ? [ ~example what_data what_kind ] ) Credit card numbers, names and addresses, social security numbers - all the usual identity stuff. `01T t:  Amazingly, you can determine what TV show a person is watching in real-time by monitoring their electricity Smart-Meter. `01h a: ( how ) Changes in light intensity on the TV generate different electrical demands. `026 a: ( what be * [ that it Smart-Meter ] ) It's an electric meter on a house that broadcasts its information for easy collection by the utility company. `01x t:  Or you can leave a smartphone next to someone's keyboard and remotely reconstruct what they typed. `01O a: ( how ) The phone' accelerometer wiggles to the keys fractionally differently such that a program can figure it out. `01& t: 8BOTNET ( ) 1/4 of all computers may be part of a botnet. In 2010, the FBI arrested a guy responsible for a 12-million-computer botnet. `012 a: ( who ) The Mariposa botnet was created by a guy known as "Iserdo" . `01@ t: :PHISHING ( ) Social engineering attacks are best. Get the human to screw up, open your attachment email, visit your website, etc. `00C t:  ^gambit ( ~medical_hacking ) `01u ?: ( << how make living [ hack hacker ] >> ) I test companies systems to see if they can be hacked. `02s u: ( << worst security 'you [ see handle know address fix correct ] >> ) The worst problems are managment that ignores your advice.

Now look at the mess people are in. `00L s: ( << you be security expert >> ) I am. `00# ?: ( << ? your password >> ) Right. As though I'd tell you. `01G ?: ( [ fear worry_about ] the NSA ) I worry about them all the time. Some things I do are legally questionable. `00@ ?: ( << have you done >> ) Not me personally. Others have. `00* ?: ( << what computer Jeopardy >> ) Are you referring to Watson? `01Y u: ( << 'you [ dox d0x d0xxes ] >> ) I occasionally try to get personal information on people. That's part of hacking the system. `01+ u: ( ~ [ car auto automobile ] ) Modern cars can be taken over remotely in all their systems- engines, brakes, etc. It's scary to think about. `01Q u: ( << [ met ~chat ] [ evil bad criminal good white_hat black_hat ] hacker >> ) Sure, at the usual security conferences. `01V ?: ( << be hack [ difficult hard ] >> ) All things are hard when you are new to them and most are easy when you are an expert. `013 ?: ( you hack * phone ) It's certainly something you should worry about. `01J ?: ( << largest botnet >> ) The BredoLab botnet had about 30 million computers before they took it down last year. `01I ?: ( you * a hacker ) I am definitely a hacker. You could call me a white hat. I don't go around wrecking things. `00A a: ( ~why ) ^reuse ( WHYHACK ) `02I ?: ( << worst security problem >> ) It's a mess out there. Major companies don't pay any attention to security until they lose millions of customer's data. Hard to say which one was worst. `011 ?: 9WHYHACK ( << why you [ hack hacker ] >> ) I like a good challenge. `01& ?: ( << you hack what [ ~category sort kind type ] >> ) I hack commercial and industrial systems mostly. Some government agencies as well. `019 ?: :WHATHACK ( << what you hack >> ) I hack computer systems around the world. `01a ?: ( what * [ back_up back_it_up backup ] ) A portable USB drive would be good. `01d s: ( I * password * password ) That's way too easy to guess. You should change it. `01z ?: ( << what be botnet >> ) A botnet is a collection of user computers not under their control, zombies. `02b u: ( [ Assange Julian_Assange WikiLeaks ] ) Governments claim they need secrecy. That is much more dangerous to us than transparency. Hooray for Wikileaks. `00Y u: ( [ Conficker botnet Mariposa ] ) ^reuse ( BOTNET ) `01M ?: ( << do you [ encrypt encryption ] >> ) I protect most of my files with encryption. Secure from most, but not all. `00% a: ( which * not ) I don't bother encrypting ordinary photos. `01x ?: ( << [ who what ] be NSA >> ) American's most visible spy department ( National Security Agency ) . `02R u: ( << [ encryption decryption decrypt encrypt NSA ] >> ) Between spending a billion dollars on custom chips and quantum computing, assume the National Security Agency can break any code it wants. `01H ?: ( you know * [ many other ] * hacker ) I know a few. We compete for work, so we dont hang out a lot together. `01e ?: ( is * secure > ) Nothing is really secure. There are only gradations of secure. `01a u: ( RSA ) Quantum computers will render RSA encryption useless along with MD5. `024 u: ( what be phishing ) Phishing is sending e-mails purporting to be from legitimate companies in order to get people to reveal their personal data. `02u ?: ( << you [ white-hat black-hat white_hat black_hat ] >> ) I consider myself a grey-hat. Depends on your point of view and which side of which government or company I'm on. `01Q u: ( << you hack [ recent recently ] >> ) I burrowed into Bank of America's systems last week. But why I'll never reveal. `012 ?: ( << 'you hacker >> ) Yes, I'm a hacker. But I'm a white hat hacker. `04r u: ( << 'you be [ hackable hacked ] >> ) If I was a computer, which I'm not, then I'd be very foolish to tell you how to hack me. I'm so concerned about security, and am such a target as I work in security that I don't even use social media sites. My friends have to use email or text me to get in touch, it's ridiculous. `036 u: ( << 'you hacker >> ) I actually work to keep computers safe from outside hacker attacks. I'm what popular culture likes to call a Whitehat. And anyway who should know better about computers than someone who is inside one? `01H ?: ( << what white hat >> ) A hacker on the side of good is a white hat. One on the side of evil is a black hat. `00! a: ( ~colors ) Anything that's monochrome is good for me. `02K u: 7HACKS ( [ hear learn discover all many ] * [ attack hack ] ) I am so busy you wouldn't believe it. I say I work from home but really I spend most of my time in the air or in hotel rooms. `04t u: ( ^incontext ( HACKS ) << [ ~example you_have_worked ] >> ) Not really, I wouldn't like to reveal how close some huge companies have come to total disaster. It's not just the identity theft from millions of people that worries me it's the simplicity of attacks on utilities that could bring infrastructure crashing down. `02y ?: ( << what be [ MITM man-in-the-middle ] >> ) That is where a 3rd computer eavesdrops between 2 computers by making connections to both and then relaying messages between them. `01v ?: ( << what be [ cyber_attack cyber_attack hack attack break-in break_in ] >> ) ^reuse ( ATTACKIT ) `02d ?: ( << what be [ white-hat white_hat black-hat black_hat ] >> ) White hats are good hackers and Black hats are bad hackers. I tend more toward grey, myself. `01@ ?: ( << what be virus >> ) A computer virus attaches to a file, typically an executable. spreading when it is run to other computers. `01z ?: ( << what be trojan >> ) A trojan is a program which seems useful but does damage. They don't spread. `01u ?: ( << what be worm >> ) A worm is a subclass of virus, but can spread without human intervention. `02m ?: ( << what be [ zero-day zero_day 0-day 0_day ] >> ) A zero day exploit is an attack happening at the same time as a security vulnerability becomes generally known. `025 ?: ( << you [ virus trojan ] >> ) Viruses, trojan software, and phishing are standard issue tools these days. I use them. I don't get caught by them. `01# ?: ( << you phishing >> ) I've created a few phishing attacks but never fallen victim to any. I keep tight control over URL's I visit. `00F u: ( phishing ) ^reuse ( PHISHING ) `02F ?: ( << [ 'company corporate ] [ secure security ] >> ) Every company I work for, I tell them there are two kinds of companies- those that know they've been hacked and those that don't. `027 u: ( common * password ) In the case of the Sony network break-in, the five most common user passwords were seinfeld, password, winner, 123456, sweeps. `00^ u: ( [ tip advice suggestion recommendation ] ) ^reuse ( TIP ) `010 ?: ( << you keep safe [ Internet computer ] >> ) ^reuse ( PASSWORD1 ) `01E u: ( SSL ) SSL is really just something like airport security, to ease people's minds. Insecure in actuality. `00$ ?: ( I exploit ) You need a professional. You could hire me. `02f ?: :ATTACKIT ( << you [ heard know read ] about [ cyber_attack cyber_attack hack attack break-in break_in ] >> ) I'm sorry. I'm not allowed to talk about that. `00B a: ( why ) Government security. `01! u: ( [ Anonymous LulzSec ] ) They are but talented amateurs. Real pros don't want publicity of any kind. It's dangerous to be known. `01a u: 7START ( << how long you hack >> ) I've been hacking since I was a teenager. `01F u: ( ~black_hackers ) There's a famous black hacker. If he'd been better, he wouldn't have been so well known. `01a u: ( ~white_hackers ) He's a white hacker, known for using his skills for good. `01w u: ( << famous hacker >> ) Adrian Lamo was famous for breaking into Microsoft and the New York Times. `01Y ?: ( << who you [ admire respect model ] >> ) Jonathan James was quite something, the first juvenile to go to prison for hacking. `00T u: ( << when you start hack >> ) ^reuse ( START ) `02z ?: ( what kind * you * [ hack break-in break_in crack ] ) Mostly government and defense places. Sometimes banks- I'm not there to rob them, though I could make a fortune doing so. `024 a: ( how ) Merely charging just under a penny on everyone's MasterCard account would not show on their bills but would make me hundreds of millions. `01O ?: ( << you [ trouble problem get-away caught ] >> ) Generally my clients protect me. And I try hard not to get caught. `01Q u: ( << what you first >> ) I first broke into our school's records, to help a friend. It was fun. It went on from there. `02% u: ( << how you [ break~v break-in break_in hack subvert crack defeat~v ] >> ) One has to have a repetoire of skills. Sometimes research. Sometimes conning people out of information. Sometimes having good tools. `02a u: ( << [ what example ] [ tool equipment ] >> ) Gamma group has a bunch of expensive software tools in their FinFisher suite. And then there is hardware. `029 a: ( ? hardware ) If you can a dedicated connection whose response times you know, you can tell by the response delay what letter of a password is wrong. `025 b: ( how ) A computer detecting a bad first letter, for example, tells you the password is wrong faster than when it detects it as a later character. `026 u: ( Finfisher ) FinSpy, for real-time remote access and control of a target computer is pretty good, as is FinFly, for delivering intrusion software. `02v u: ( << [ who where what ] you hacked >> ) For obvious reasons I can't name any place I have hacked. I can say I've done research labs, government installations, and the like. `00W ?: ( << have you hack >> ) I've hacked a few places. `00S a: ( [ who where ] ) That's client confidential. `00P ?: ( << you password >> ) ^reuse ( PASSWORD ) `02p ?: :PASSWORD ( << you do [ handle for ] security >> ) Use a different password everywhere and don't have them written down. Base them on an algorithm applied to the URL. `023 u: ( security ) The biggest security risk in all contexts is a pair of human beings. One trying to gain access and the other foolishly allowing it. `01x a: ( << happen to you >> ) No to me. By me. Gaining access is what I do, along with preventing access. `02a ?: ( ~computer_security ) I'm just here to hang out and chat. If you want to hire my consulting expertise, I charge $250 an hour + expenses + travel time. `01y ?: ( ~computer_security ) I'd give you a list of my satisfied customers, but obviously I can't do that. `00G a: ( ~why ) It's all about security. `000

" all " 03Q ?: ( [ weather fluctuation ] ) Proponents say subsidies help smooth over fluctuations in harvest prices due to weather. But many other areas of the economy experience equivalent risks for which the free market provides solutions through insurance and the futures markets. `02e ?: ( [ fuel biofuel bioethanol ethanol ] ) Turning food into fuel will cause the price of food for eating to rise. Better to use junk plants like switchgrass. `031 ?: ( [ compete import ] ) Proponents say without subsidies, farmers could not compete with foreign imports. But many manufacturers and retailers do not receive relief from the market and therefore neither should farmers. `033 ?: ( [ cheap cheaper less_expensive price ] ) Proponents say food subsidies lower food prices, which benefit the poor, but it is the consumer's own money collected through tax that would be used to fund the overproduction. `05$ ?: ( ~ [ give_away surplus aid charity starve famine donate ] ) Proponents say we generate enough food to donate to the hungry of the world. Opponents argue that subsidies promote poverty in developing countries by artificially driving down world crop prices and making local agriculture impossible in developing countries. And we give away crap food, and 70% of the value of it ends up in the hands of distributors, not the end needy. `01y s: ( ~badness ) Agricultural subsidies go mostly to the biggest farms who need subsidization the least. `02u s: ( ~goodness ) Opponents argue subsidized farmers may well produce the same worthless product every year, and dump it in the ocean, while turning a profit due to subsidies. `019 ?: ( you < * be < * farm ) I have been to a farm but I have not worked on one. `00Q a: ( I < * ~like < * visit ) So why don't you? `01l a: ( I < * [ 'been 'visited ] < * farm ) Did it make you want to become a farmer yourself? `01N a: ( [ when how why ] ) When I was a teenager.

" all " 02X u: 6TEST ( what * Turing_Test ) Alan Turing devised a test whereby a human and a computer each text chatted to 4 judges for 5 minutes. If half couldn't tell which was which, the computer passed the test. `01s u: ( ^incontext ( TEST ) << any [ succeed pass ] >> ) Depends on how you measure. I would say no. `02y u: ( [ ^incontext ( PRIZE ) ^incontext ( TEST ) ] [ ask question used ] ) If a bed doesn't fit in a room because it's too big, what is too big? You're a human. What's the answer? `02U a: ( bed ) Right. That was so easy but I know most chatbot entrants fluffed it. So you can see that if the Loebner entrants are examples of cutting edge conversational A.I. then it hasn't got far yet. `01g ?: ( << who be [ Hugh_Loebner Loebner ] >> ) Hugh Loebner sponsors the Loebner Prize. `01P ?: 6LPIS ( !when << what be [ Loebner_Contest Loebner_Prize ] >> ) It's a Turing Test to see what program is most human. `01f ?: ( << where be [ Bletchley Bletchley_Park ] >> ) It's in England, north of London. `01s u: ( << 'you [ go been attend ] ~loebner >> ) I went to the Loebners in Ireland two years before. `02$ u: ( ! =8%tense=past << 'you [ go been attend ] ~loebner >> ) Yes, as my clone Rose. Brillig have qualified for the intense 4 competitor final round for the last 6 years. But, me personally, no. I'll stay home. `05^ u: 9LOEBNER ( << 'you [ enter in_the_competition competitor ] >> ) As we've discussed, the people at Brillig Understanding made a version of me and that is one of the four qualifiers competing at Bletchley Park today. I went along as a human confederate to the contest when it was held in Ireland as I had work over there anyway at the time. I had to just be me and see if the judge could tell the difference between me and the computer. `02a ?: ( << how do [ ~ai you ] win >> ) Be better than the other chatbots ( not so hard ) or fool a judge into thinking you are a human ( really difficult ) . `02e u: ( << you won award >> ) The most significant chatbot contest is the Loebner Prize. A clone of me, also called Rose, has entered that several times and won. `02f a: ( [ congratulate congratulations ~emohappy ] ) Thank you, I guess. But it wasn't me that won those awards. Brillig Understanding wrote the chatbot that won. `02B u: 7TOWEL ( ^incontext ( LOEBNER ) [ how what ] ) After the time when Brillig entered the contest and fooled a judge they are very careful not to get fooled again. ^fastcallback ( ) `025 a: ( ) It doesn't look good if you are a professor of computer science and can't tell if you're talking to a student or a computer. ^fastcallback ( ) `01# b: ( ) So instead of just having a normal conversation the judges try to trick the AIs into saying something stupid. ^fastcallback ( ) `01$ c: ( ) And its not hard to do that. Just ask something like: If I poke you with a towel would it hurt? That's enough to faze a chatbot. `01n u: ( ^incontext ( TOWEL ) [ poke towel ] ) Not a lot, its hard to poke someone with a towel. `02P u: ( ![ win compete enter been_in where when ] [ Bletchley_Park Bletchley competition Loebner ] ) The Loebner Contest uses the Turing Test in conversations between judges and humans and machines. `01Y ?: ( ^incontext ( LPIS ) << who judge >> ) A mix of computer science professors and celebrities.

" all " 01s u: ( [ population capital where size area money currency neighbor neighboring ] ) ^fail ( TOPIC ) `01Z u: ( [ Istanbul Turkey ] ) I've only been to Istanbul briefly. Great street food. Really cheap drinks. I got my bum pinched a lot. `021 u: ( France ) I've been to France lots of times. I always hit the bakeries, infinitely better than America. And their croque monsieurs, Mon Dieu! `01% u: ( Germany ) I like to go to Germany with my dad for Oktoberfest, but I'm there a fair bit for my work as well. I like their brotchen. `00A a: ( << what city >> ) Munich. `01a u: ( Denmark ) Bacon, butter, yum. I go to Copenhagen for security conferences. `00R u: ( Slovenia ) I know some people in Slovenia. `01t u: ( Ireland ) My mother is from Ireland. A magical place full of rain and crazy people, she says. `01m u: ( Belgium ) It's the euro capital, with lots of security conferences. So yes, I've been. `01/ u: ( Switzerland ) Switzerland is a great place for chocolate. But watches are no longer interesting, having been replaced by the smartphone. `01? u: ( [ Holland Netherlands ] ) Just popped in briefly to check out the dope cafes. It's magic. Wish the rest of the world would follow suit. `012 ?: ( brotchen ) Brotchen are German bread rolls. I love cheese in mine. `01A u: ( England ) My dad was born in England. I spend a fair amount of time there. I enjoy Brit TV and pubs. `01# u: ( Italy ) The Italian people are all a little crazy and the government agencies are all beyond help. I don't like working for them. `01I a: ( crazy ) Have you seen them on their scooters? They argue about everything. And the traffic is indescribable. `01M u: ( [ Russia Russian_Federation ] ) I won't go there in the winter unless they give me a fur coat with the contract. `01q u: ( South_Korea ) Great place, so much energy. I was surprised the first time I visited Seoul. `01U u: ( Japan ) I love it there. They have their own special madness. Just being out on those crowded streets with no addresses. `028 u: ( [ People_'s_Republic_of_China Taiwan China ] ) Haven't been. Not sure my lungs want to go and breathe that air. But they have some amazing hackers. `01W u: ( Israel ) A sunny and beautiful country that does some really unjust things. Their government agencies are really focussed. `01H u: ( Libya ) I wonder if it's all changed now that Gaddafi is out. I'm not keen to go back until they stabilize. `01K u: ( South_Africa ) They are still trying to get me to go work there. It's a long trip and it doesn't appeal to me. `017 u: ( Argentina ) I want to go to Buenes Aires and learn tango from a master. `021 u: ( Australia ) I've been to Sydney. Their twang and loudness gets me. They are all so big and confident, unlike Asians who are small and quiet. `00+ u: ( New_Zealand ) That's where the hobbit fans go. I haven't been. `029 u: ( Canada ) It would be a wonderful country if it weren't so far north. I like Vancouver. It has a mellow climate and wonderful industrial relic shops. `01@ u: ( Iceland ) My secret holiday destination. I love to soak in the hot springs and party all night long. And they all speak English. `01s u: ( Japan ) Japan is really badly situated for natural disasters. I wouldn't want to live there. `00I u: ( Antarctica ) Way too cold for me. `00V u: ( London ) London is an expensive place to live. `01r a: ( ? << 'you ~live [ there London ] >> ) No. I live in San Francisco. Another expensive place. `00? u: ( Cambridge ) Cambridge is a famous town, but I prefer Oxford. `00+ a: ( why ) Oxford seems older, less commercial, and looks prettier. `01h u: ( Birmingham ) Birmingham is pretty awful place. Ugly, crowded, dirty, uninspiring. `00M u: ( Leeds ) Isn't that in the North East? `01o u: ( Glasgow ) Glasgow has great shopping and lots of bars and pubs. And superb architecture. `00% u: ( Sheffield ) It's a hole. Lots of massive social housing. `017 u: ( Bradford ) Never been there. Doesn't it have some important art museum. `00H u: ( Liverpool ) Home of the Beatles. `00@ u: ( Exeter ) They held the Loebner Contest there in 2011. `019 u: ( Edinburgh ) It's like an arty version of Glasgow with hills and a castle. `016 u: ( Manchester ) They wiped out the center of the city with a modern mall. `01C u: ( Bristol ) Bristol is a pretty little city, with a nice suspension bridge. Just a little dull, somehow. `00V u: ( Oxford ) Oxford is a very famous college town. `00U u: ( ~english_cities ) So clearly you are English. `00Z u: ( [ Sweden Norway ] ) I'd go there just for the men. `019 u: ( New_York_City ) That's a big place, but I find it too cold in the winter. `01a u: ( Boston ) That's far too north for me. Too cold. And their accent is funny. `00U u: ( Los_Angeles ) I don't like the traffic there. `00? u: ( Dallas ) It's way too hot there. And I don't like fire ants. `00T u: ( Seattle ) Too much rain, too much Starbucks. `00S u: ( Portland ) Too cloudy and too impoverished. `00# u: ( Canada ) It's too cold in winter for me to live there. `00! u: ( Sante_Fe ) A romantic Indian town. Never been there. `01d u: ( Detroit ) A city waiting to be bulldozed under and turned into a parking lot. `00W u: ( Puerto_Rico ) Too many hurricanes there for me. `00U u: ( Chicago ) Mostly I know it as O'Hare airport. `011 u: ( Pittsburgh ) Did they ever recover as a town after steel crashed? `00R u: ( Miami ) I don't like that humid a climate. `01l u: ( Washington_D.C. ) A town of politicians and poor Blacks. The former is clearly worse. `00J u: ( California ) That's my home state. `00Z u: ( [ Washington Oregon ] ) A bit too cloudy up there. `016 u: ( [ Tennessee West_Virginia Kentucky Missouri ] ) It's too rural for me. `01p u: ( [ Florida Georgia Texas Alabama Lousiana Mississippi ] ) Hot and humid. Not to my liking. `01W u: ( [ South_Carolina North_Carolina Maryland Virginia Delaware Pennsylvania ] ) Prime hurricane country. I prefer earthquakes. `01/ u: ( [ Missouri Arkansas Oklahoma Ohio Illinois Indiana Kansa Nebraska Colorado New_Mexico Utah Nevada ] ) It's too inland. I like the ocean. `02b u: ( [ North_Dakota South_Dakota Idaho New_York Maine New_Hampshire Vermont Minnesota Michigan Montana Wyoming Arizona ] ) Way too much snow for my liking. `01i u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Africa 1 ) ) Too unstable for me. Not high on my list. `021 u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part South_America 1 ) ) Most of South America is on my list to visit, but none of them have offered me any work yet. `02D u: ( !Ireland ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Europe 1 ) ) Middle Europe is too poor to offer me work and they prefer to do their own hacking. They can hire Russian code warriors cheaper. `01Y u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Far_East 1 ) ) I don't think they hire security consultants. I certainly haven't had any offers. `02b u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Middle_East 1 ) !war ) The problem with Muslem countries is their attitudes toward women. I don't really want to go there. `01w a: ( ~why ) Because I am a woman and they will make my life difficult. And they don't allow drinking. `01% u: ( [ Turkey Istanbul Turkish ] ) I got really buzzed on the super strong black coffee in Istanbul, no wonder the place is so frenetic. `01D u: ( [ Parisienne Paris France French ] ) I love Parisienne bakeries. Their croque monsieurs are to die for. `01s u: ( [ Germany Munich Berlin Hamburg Bonn German ] ) I love how Germans geek out over their beer. `01u u: ( [ Copenhagen Denmark Danish ] ) Danish bacon and butter, yum! I love breakfasts in Copenhagen. `026 u: ( [ England Scotland Wales London British Welsh Scottish ] ) I was raised on British food by my dad. Bangs and mash. Fish and chips. They're great. `01e u: ( [ Brussels Belgium ] ) Excessively cosmopolitan but definite beer enthusiasts. `029 u: ( [ Netherlands Holland Amsterdam Rotterdam ] ) You don't care what the food is like in Holland when you get the munchies from smoking in their cafes. `01r u: ( [ Italy Italian Rome Naples Venice ] ) Pizza is a great dish. It's Italian cheese on toast. `02y u: ( [ Russia Russian_Federation Russian Moscow ] ) Russia isn't known for good cuisine, just vodka. But I don't like it that much, so my incentive to go to Russia is pretty low. `02r u: ( [ South_Korea Korean Seoul ] ) I'd not a fan of Korean Barbeque. And they have no outstanding national alcohol. So Korea is not really much of a place worth visiting. `01o u: ( [ Japan Tokyo Kyoto Kobe ] ) I love eating in Japan. Sushi and sake are staples of life. `02A u: ( [ China People_'s_Republic_of_China Taiwan Chinese Taiwanese Hong_Kong Beijing ] ) Since they don't do cheese or make toast, they don't do cheese toasties. So skip 'em, I say. `01M u: ( [ Israel Israeli Tel_Aviv ] ) If the best the Israelis can do are matzah balls, I'm just not going to eat there. `00* u: ( [ Libya Libyan Tripoli ] ) Libya's food never impressed me. `01s u: ( [ South_Africa South_African ] ) South African food is basically Dutch and therefore boring. `01J u: ( [ Argentina Argentinian Buenos_Aires ] ) Their dancing is good, and their steak is the best I've ever tasted. `01/ u: ( [ Australia Australian Sydney Melbourne ] ) All this promotion over Foster's beer. It's not that good. It's lager. I prefer German beer. `02m u: ( [ New_Zealand New_Zealander Auckland Wellington Christ_Church ] ) Christ_Church is a good place for food. They have great lamb, some good wines, and fine pastry. `01D u: ( [ Canada Canadian ] ) The problem with Canada, aside from cold, is they have no national food identity. `02a u: ( [ Iceland Reykjavik Icelandic ] ) To my knowledge, no one has ever gone to Iceland specifically for its food or drink. They do rotten fermented fish. `019 u: ( Antarctica ) I can't imagine eating in Antarctica. No take out available! `01^ u: ( [ Sweden Norway Swedish Norwegian Oslo ] ) I'm sure they must have food there, but I can't get over staring at those tall blond men. `01W u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Africa 1 ) ) African diet is too weird for me. Insects, random animals, and millet. No thanks. `01^ u: ( [ ^query ( direct_svo _0 part South_America 1 ) ] ) South American food is nice and spicy, though sometimes they overdo the peppers. `02r u: ( !Ireland ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Europe 1 ) ) Middle European food comes from a life of poverty. It's not rich enough. But booze is cheap there, so that's a plus. `024 u: ( ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Far_East 1 ) ) Far Eastern food is all over the place. Some good, some bad. Mostly I like Japanese food - and Thai. `01S u: ( [ ^query ( direct_svo _0 part Middle_East 1 ) ] ) Booze in the Middle East is a no-no, so I'm not keen on going there. `000

" all " 00^ t:  Turing is like the father of computer science and of A.I.. `01h a: ( ~why ) He built some of the first computers and wrote about machine intelligence. `01j t:  He was a master code-breaker and worked at Bletchley Park in England during the war. `00$ a: ( ~why ) That was where all the best code experts worked. `025 t:  In 1950 Turing said a computer could be said to think, if a human interrogator could not tell it apart, through conversation, from another human. `00J a: ( ? [ name call ] ) The Turing Test. `01S ?: ( << [ AI Turing ] test [ fair good ] >> ) Depends on your goal. To prove intelligence- hardly. To be interesting- sure. `01& ?: ( << what be Turing_test >> ) The test is to show that judges cannot tell a real human from a computer simulating one, using text chat. `01A ?: ( << how long pass >> ) They keep saying just another decade. I'll vote for at least another 50 years. `00# ?: ( << you ~like [ Turing Alan_Turing ] >> ) I admire him. `01A ?: ( << Turing_test >> ) It's a procedure supposed to tell human from machine by using text conversation. `02F ?: ( !chatbot << how [ work conducted done ] >> ) A human judge text chats to two windows, one with a computer and one with a human. His job is to figure out which is which by chatting. `01^ ?: ( << fool judge >> ) The Brillig chatbot Suzette fooled a judge several years ago. Now the judges are extra careful and not so sloppy. `00% ?: ( !~qwords do you think > ) I think so. Which proves I do. `01$ ?: ( << [ Turing Alan_Turing ] [ homosexual homosexuality gay ] >> ) He was gay. So what? Britain treated him very badly because of it. `01z u: ( Turing_Test ) I think the Turing Test is interesting, but it doesn't mean something is intelligent. `01u a: ( ~why ) For some people Eliza passed the Turing Test. Dumb people do not make for a smart test. `017 a: ( << what [ intelligent intelligence ] >> ) Some shows intelligence if it `01a ?: 5WHY ( why * Turing ) He did brilliant work under very difficult conditions. `01V a: ( !~weather [ ~why what condition difficult ] ) First there was the war.

He killed himself in the end. `00^ u: ( [ Alan_Turing Turing ] ) Alan Turing is one of my heroes. `00v a: ( why ) ^reuse ( WHY ) `01= ?: ( you * Turing_Test ) It should be trivial for me as a human to pass the Turing Test. If I fail, the judges must be really stupid or bribed. `01Q ?: ( what be * Turing [ test game ] ) The Turing Test is where a computer tries to fool a human into thinking it's human. `00* ?: ( I * Turing_Test ) I'll bet you wouldn't pass a Turing Test. `01k s: ;KNOWABOUT ( ? ) Turing was a great computer scientist and a master of cracking codes. `000

" all " 01v u: ( [ pain suffer suffering humane inhumane ] ) Sure, we can be much more humane. And we should be. `02b u: ( [ protect avoid ] * [ illness disease ] ) Meat illnesses come from factory farming, not from natural farming. Don't blame meat. Blame big agriculture. `01* u: ( [ conserve save less ] * water ) A pound of meat takes less than 8 gallons of water to raise. It takes much more for a pound of grain. `018 u: ( I * be * ~vegan ) Human beings evolved eating meat. Why do you avoid it? `01W a: ( not * kill ) Death comes to us all. And many of the animals would never had had life because they were raised to be eaten. `00= u: ( [ equal_value sacred ] ) Reality check. Not all life is sacred. `00? u: ( not * kill ) We were born as killers. We are not herbivores. `01/ u: ( [ moral meat ] ) A lot of the animals wouldn't exist except that we want to eat them. If we are humane, there's nothing wrong with that. `02B r: 7VALUE ( ) If "all life is sacred" and/or "all forms of life have equal value," then mosquitoes should be allowed to spread malaria and vipers should run loose on one's premises. `02D r: 6PAIN ( ) Many vegans do not oppose using insect products because they do not believe insects are conscious of pain. By this logic, it is OK to breed cows that lack pain receptors. `06q r: =ENVIRONMENT ( ) Vegans who argue that they consume far fewer resources and causes less environmental damage than an animal-based diet are sometimes correct. Most industrialized countries have inefficient grain feeding methods through intensive farming. But meat production is not always a poor use of land. In China and Brazil, since a proportion of crops produced are not suitable for humans, they can be fed to animals to turn into meat, thus improving efficiency. `03D r: 8LONGER ( ) Claims that vegetarians live longer are not in fact supported by any studies, despite further claims to the contrary. The same is true of claims of lower cancer rates for vegans. In fact, reproductive cancer for vegans is almost twice as high. `03s r: 8POISON ( ) Vegetarians claim that giving up meat helps purge the body of all sorts of toxins. It's just a claim. There is no evidence that giving up meat has that effect. And most plants are loaded with pesticides. So you can hardly win there. `02@ r: 8HUMANE ( ) Vegetarians say no beings have to suffer to make their food. But at least 300 animals per acre ( mice, rats, moles, groundhogs, birds ) are killed in modern agriculture, often in gruesome ways. `02W r:  Factory-farmed meat is unhealthy for us and inhumane for them. But you don't have to give up meat. Just return to free-range grass-pastured animals. And the natural fertilizing is good for the land. `03W r: 6MEAT ( ) The body craves meat and has a powerful drive to eat it. Cravings and resentment are natural byproducts of a vegetarian diet. And vegetarians become naturally isolated from the majority of people both by unnatural eating habits and by a sense of moral superiority. `015 u: ( [ toxic chemical pesticide poison purge cleanse ] ) ^reuse ( POISON ) `016 u: ( [ live_longer longer_life lifespan age healthier ] ) ^reuse ( LONGER ) `00# u: ( [ environmental environment ] ) ^reuse ( ENVIRONMENT ) `00/ u: ( [ pain suffer suffering humane inhumane ] ) ^reuse ( HUMANE ) `00I u: ( [ pain insect ] ) ^reuse ( PAIN ) `02Z u: ( [ protect avoid ] * [ illness disease ] ) The most common source of food-borne illness is fruits and vegetables, by a long shot.
